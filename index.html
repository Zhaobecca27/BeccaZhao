        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I’m Becca, currently pursuing my M.S. in Computer Science at Northeastern University with two years of industry experience as a software engineer.
            Previously, I was a PhD candidate in China, but I quit.
            Since then, I’ve worked at Pacific Insurance, where I optimized data pipelines and integrated a large language model, reducing claims processing latency by 10 seconds and improving accuracy by 90%.
            At NetEase, I enhanced recommendation systems, boosting daily user engagement by 15%. I’m proficient in Python, Java, and deep learning frameworks, and I’m passionate about leveraging technology to solve real-world challenges while fostering inclusivity in tech.
