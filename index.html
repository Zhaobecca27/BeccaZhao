        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, Iâ€™m Becca, currently pursuing my M.S. in Computer Science at Northeastern University with two years of industry experience as a software engineer.</p>
        <p>Previously, I was a PhD candidate in China, but I quit. Since then, Iâ€™ve worked at:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Pacific Insurance:</strong> Optimized data pipelines and integrated a large language model, reducing claims processing latency by 10 seconds and improving accuracy by 90%.</li>
            <li><strong>NetEase:</strong> Enhanced recommendation systems, boosting daily user engagement by 15%.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Iâ€™m proficient in Python, Java, and deep learning frameworks, and Iâ€™m passionate about leveraging technology to solve real-world challenges while fostering inclusivity in tech.</p>

        <h3>Machine Learning Engineer | Pacific Insurance Co., Ltd, Shanghai, China</h3>
        <p><strong>01/2023 - 08/2024</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Utilized Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to retrieve insurance claim terms and encapsulated them into APIs, achieving a recall accuracy rate of 98%.</li>
            <li>Leveraged the DeepSpeed framework to fine-tune a 14B base model using LoRA on two A100 GPUs within RLHF frameworks. Integrated the fine-tuned Large Language Model (LLM) with a claims service to facilitate insurance claim requests via FastAPI.</li>
            <li>Collaborated with the OCR team to integrate REST API to extract key information from the claims materials provided by users. Provided accuracy feedback extracted by OCR for continuous improvement.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Machine Learning Engineer Internship | NetEase, Hangzhou, China</h3>
        <p><strong>10/2022 - 01/2023</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Leveraged Spark to retrieve user data from Hive tables and performed One-hot encoding for categorical features and bucketing for numeric features.</li>
            <li>Achieved a 15% increase in Daily Active Users through deep reinforcement learning in Learning to Rank for recommendation systems, leading to improvements in user engagement and retention metrics.</li>
